# SPIFlash [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Marzogh/SPIFlash.svg?branch=v1.3.1-w.i.p)](https://travis-ci.org/Marzogh/SPIFlash)
### Arduino library for Winbond Flash Memory Chips
<sup> Download the latest stable release (v1.3.1) from <a href = "https://github.com/Marzogh/SPIFlash/releases/latest">here</a>. Please report any bugs in issues.</sup>

This library is for a the Winbond serial flash memory chips. In its current form it enables reading and writing bytes from and to various locations; reading and writing pages of bytes; continous reading/writing of data from/to arrays of bytes; sector, block and chip erase; and powering down for low power operation.

- For details of the Winbond Flash chips compatible with this library please refer to the Excel spreadsheet in the Extras folder.

#### Installation
- Click on the 'Download zip' button to the right.
- Unzip the archive and rename resulting folder to 'SPIFlash'
- Move the folder to your libraries folder (~/sketches/libraries)

#### Usage

The library is called by declaring the```SPIFLASH flash(csPin)``` constructor where 'flash' can be replaced by a user constructor of choice and 'csPin' is the Chip Select pin for the flash module.
Make sure to include ```#include<SPI.H>``` when you include ```#include<SPIFlash.h>```.
Also make sure to include ```flash.begin()``` in ```void setup()```. This enables the library to detect the type of flash chip installed and load the right parameters.

###### Notes on Address overflow and Error checking
- The library has Address overflow enabled by default - i.e. if the last address read/written from/to,  in any function, is 0xFFFFF then, the next address read/written from/to is 0x00000. This can be disabled by setting the optional last 'overflow' argument in the constructor to false - For eg. call the constructor  ```SPIFlash(csPin, false)```  instead of ```SPIFlash(csPin)```.
- All write functions have Error checking turned on by default - i.e. every byte written to the flash memory will be checked against the data stored on the Arduino. Users who require greater write speeds can disable this function by setting an optional last 'errorCheck' argument in any write function to false - For eg. call the function ```writePage(page_number, *data_buffer, false)``` instead of ```writePage(page_number, *data_buffer)```.

The library enables the following functions:

(The baudrate can be changed by calling ```Serial.begin()``` at a different baudrate in ``` void setup()```)Setting an outputType of 1 enables output in hexadecimal while an outputType of 2 enables output in decimal, CSV - over Serial.
<hr>
##### printAllPages()
Reads all pages on Flash chip and dumps it to Serial stream. This function is useful when extracting data from a flash chip onto a computer as a text file.

###### How to get data off Flash memory via Serial
<sub>(Works only for Unix based Operating Systems)</sub>

 - Make sure you include code to let you dump entire flash memory/specific page's content to Serial (Refer to the code in the _TestFlash.h_ for details on how to do this)
 - Connect your arduino to the computer.
 - Open the Arduino IDE, the IDE's Serial Monitor, and an OSX POSIX terminal.
 - Type the following command into the terminal window. ```% tail -f /dev/tty.usbmodem1411 > FlashDump.txt``` Make sure to replace the _/dev/tty.usbmodem1411_ with the port your arduino is connected to. (You can find this in Tools --> Ports in Arduino IDE 1.6.x)
 - Then type the command to read all pages into the Serial console. If you use my code from the example file the command is ```read_all_pages```
 - Wait a few seconds before typing ```Ctrl+C``` to end the tail process
 - Check that you have actually recieved all the data by typing ```% cat FlashDump.txt```. This should output the entire textfile into your terminal window.
