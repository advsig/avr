* MAX7219 14-segment Example Sketch
* Written by Radu - Eosif Mihailescu
*
* This example sketch illustrates how to use some of the basic commands in the
* MAX7219 Library. The sketch will use the MAX7219/7221 to display some
* numbers and characters on a 14-segment display.
* More information on the MAX7219/7221 chips can be found in the datasheet.
*
* HARDWARE SETUP:
* This sketch assumes you have connected two daisy-chained MAX7219/7221s to the
* SPI interface of the Arduino as explained in the README file. A 2-digit
* 14-segment common cathode display should be connected to the first two digits
* of both MAX7219/7221s. In order to allow a common-cathode display digit be
* driven by two MAX7219s, two diodes are necessary (1N4148 will do) -- connect
* the anodes of the diodes toghether with the the common cathode of the display
* digit; then connect each diode's cathode to the MAX7219 DIGn outputs. Note
* that this means you need a total of 4 diodes for a 2-digit 16-segment display.
* Also note that the MAX7221 doesn't need this setup and in that case the
* display digit common cathode can simply be tied to both DIGn outputs of both
* chips involved. Finally, a current limiting resistor should be connected
* between ISET and V+ on each chip, whose value can be determined from
* MAX7219's and the display's datasheets.
*
* 14 SEGMENT WIRING DIAGRAM:
* For those of you who appreciate images more than words, here it goes:
*
* <> /-------\    DP2 and A                  / DP1 to DP           / DP2 to DP
*    |\  ^  /|                      1st chip | A to A     2nd chip | G2 to A
*    | \ | / |    F, H, I, J and B     |     | B to B        |     | H to B
*    \  \v/  /                         ^     | C to C        ^     | I to C
*    <--> <-->    G1 and G2            |     | D to D        |     | J to D
*    /  /^\  \                      Com. K   | E to E     Com. K   | K to E
*    | / | \ |    E, M, L, K and C           | F to F              | L to F
*    |/  v  \|                               \ G1 to G             \ M to G
*    \-------/ <> D and DP1
*
* Each 14-segment display digit spans two MAX7219/7221s and is connected to the
* same digit on both chips. The common cathode of the display digit connects to
* the same DIGn output on both chips, via diodes for MAX7219 and straight
* through for MAX7221.
*
* USING THE SKETCH:
* Compile, upload, enjoy :-)
