- add some graphic primitives in a separate class (GDI-like) that would use MAX7219 as a display driver
- related to the above, implement spectrum analyzer specifics for bargraph mode (decay, peaks)
- add HAL support (shift register routing for LOAD/#CS) to the code
- add SPI arbitrator support
- implement external element controllers, mainly for animations ticked off from loop(). Rotating dash, spinning zero and scanning bargraph come to mind. Blinking cursor (on matrices) also seems like a good candidate.
- implement rotation for driving opposite polarity displays (i.e. common anode)
