* MAX7219 Cascaded Devices Example Sketch
* Written by Radu - Eosif Mihailescu
*
* This example sketch illustrates how to use some of the basic commands in the
* MAX7219 Library. The sketch will use two cascaded MAX7219/7221s to display
* various graphics on the connected displays.
* More information on the MAX7219/7221 chips can be found in the datasheet.
*
* HARDWARE SETUP:
* This sketch assumes you have connected your first MAX7219/7221 to the SPI
* interface of the Arduino as explained in the README file; the second one
* should also be connected as in the README (DIN to the first's DOUT etc.).
* 4 7-segment, common cathode displays are connected to the first 4 digits of
* the first MAX7219/7221, one bargraph display is connected to the last digit
* of the first chip and another, identical, one to the first digit of the 
* second chip; finally, a 5x7 dot matrix display is connected to the last 5 
* digits of the second chip. See the 7Segment and BarGraph example sketches
* for connection diagrams for the 7-segment and bargraph displays, the matrix
* connections are detailed below. Finally, one current limiting resistor
* should be connected between ISET and V+ (of each chip), whose value can be
* determined from MAX7219's and the displays' datasheets.
*
* SAFETY WARNING:
* Please double check power consumption figures *before* powering this up.
* Depending on the display types/models used and your particular situation,
* you may need to use a separate +5V power supply for the MAX7219/7221 and LED
* displays. No, I will not pay for your smoking USB port so please be a good
* engineer and do the math yourself before plugging this in.
